# abc

Flutter GetX Pattern.

## GetX Structure
    - /app  
    # This is where all the application's directories will be contained  
        - /data
        # Directory responsible for containing everything related to our data
            - /service
                # This is where we store our Services
                - my_service.dart
            - /provider
            # Our data provider, can be an api, local database or firebase for example.
                - my_api_provider.dart
            # Here, our asynchronous data request, http, local database functions must remain ...
            - /model
            # Our classes, or data models responsible for abstracting our objects.
                - my_model.dart
            - /repository
                - my_repository.dart
            # Here our repositories are just classes that will mediate the communication between our controller and our data.
            # Our controllers won't need to know where the data comes from, and you can use more than one repository on a controller if you need to.
            # The repositories must be separated by entities, and can almost always be based on their database tables.
            # And inside it will contain all its functions that will request data from a local api or database.
            # That is, if we have a user table that we will persist as, edit, add, update and delete, all these functions are requested 
            # from an api, we will have a repository with this object of the api where we will call all the respective 
            # functions to the user. So the controller does not need to know where it comes from, the repository being a 
            # mandatory attribute for the controllers in this model, you should always initialize the controller with at - /repository
            - /service.dart
                - auth_example_service.dart
            # This class is like a GetxController, it shares the same lifecycle ( onInit(), onReady(), onClose()). But has no "logic" inside of it.
            # It just notifies GetX Dependency Injection system, that this subclass can not be removed from memory.
            # So is super useful to keep your "Services" always reachable and active with Get.find().
            # Like ApiService, StorageService, CacheService.
        - /modules
        # Each module consists of a page, its respective GetXController and its dependencies or Bindings.
        # We treat each screen as an independent module, as it has its only controller, and can also contain its dependencies.
        # If you use reusable widgets in this, and only in this module, you can choose to add a folder for them.
            - /my_module
                - my_page.dart
                - my_controller.dart or my_service.dart, or both.
                - my_binding.dart
                - /local_widgets
        # The Binding class is a class that decouples dependency injection, while "binding" routes to the state manager and the dependency manager.
        # This lets you know which screen is being displayed when a specific controller is used and knows where and how to dispose of it.
        # In addition, the Binding class allows you to have SmartManager configuration control.
        # You can configure how dependencies are to be organized and remove a route from the stack, or when the widget used for disposition, or none of them.

        - /global_widgets 
        # Widgets that can be reused by multiple **modules**.  

        - /routes
        # In this repository we will deposit our routes and pages.  
        # We chose to separate into two files, and two classes, one being routes.dart, containing its constant routes and the other for routing.  
            - my_routes.dart
            # class Routes {
            # This file will contain your constants ex:  
            # class Routes { const HOME = '/ home'; }  
            - my_pages.dart
            # This file will contain your array routing ex :  
            # class AppPages { static final pages = [  
            #  GetPage(name: Routes.HOME, page:()=> HomePage()) 
            # ]};  

        - /theme
        #Here we can create themes for our widgets, texts and colors
            - text_theme.dart  
            # inside ex: final textTitle = TextStyle(fontSize: 30)  
            - color_theme.dart  
            # inside ex: final colorCard = Color(0xffEDEDEE)  
            - app_theme.dart  
            # inside ex: final textTheme = TextTheme(headline1: TextStyle(color: colorCard))  
        - /utils
        #Here you can insert utilities for your application, such as masks, form keys or widgets
            - keys.dart  
            # inside ex: static final GlobalKey formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
            - masks.dart  
            # inside ex: static final maskCPF = MaskTextInputFormatter(mask: "###.###.###-##", filter: {"#": RegExp(r'[0-9]')});  
            - helpers.dart  
        # Use classes to make your variables easier to use, eg Keys.myKey, Masks.maskCPF

    - main.dart  
    # main file
    # proposed by william Silva and Kauê Murakami
    # We also have a version in packages to vocvê that is used to the good old MVC
